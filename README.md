# Bluesky wombot ðŸ¦‹

Bot based on a template repo for building [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) bots that post on their own schedule. It uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to build the bot and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to schedule the posts.

## How to use

To run this bot locally on your own machine you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version 18.16.0.

#### Schedule

The schedule is controlled by the GitHub Actions workflow in [./.github/workflows/post.yml](./.github/workflows/post.yml). The [schedule trigger](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) uses cron syntax to schedule when the workflow runs and your bot posts. [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/) is a good way to visualise it.

For example, the following YAML will schedule your bot to post at 5:30 and 17:30 every day.

```yml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "30 5,17 * * *"
```

Be warned that many GitHub Actions jobs are scheduled to happen on the hour, so that is a busy time and may see your workflow run later than expected or be dropped entirely.
